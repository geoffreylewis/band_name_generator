## Version History

**Version 1.0**  
*4/19/2024*  
* Program is done (for now).
* Created 3 questions instead of 2, and spaced out the lines to be more aesthetically pleasing.
* Perhaps later, I will add str() and capitalize() so that users don't have to worry about the wrong user input.

*4/19/2024*  
* This program has just been started.
